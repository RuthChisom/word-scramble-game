# Guess the Word Game

## Description
This is a simple word guessing game where the user needs to guess the correct word based on a scrambled word and a provided hint. The game will display a scrambled version of the word, and the player needs to unscramble it.

## How to Play
1. The game starts with a scrambled word displayed on the screen.
2. A hint about the word is provided to help you guess.
3. Type your guess into the input field.
4. Click the "Guess" button to submit your guess.
5. If your guess is correct, a success message is shown, and you can click "Next Word" to get a new scrambled word.
6. If your guess is incorrect, an error message is displayed, and you can try again.
7. You can keep guessing until you get the correct word.

## Features
- **Scrambled Word**: The word is randomly scrambled each time.
- **Hints**: A hint is provided for each word to guide the user.
- **Next Word**: After a correct guess, you can click "Next Word" to move on to the next word.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that you cannot submit empty guesses.
- **Empty Word List Handling**: If the word list is empty, an error message is displayed.

## Optional Features (To Be Added Later)
- **Timer**: A countdown timer to make the game more challenging.
- **Score Tracking**: Track the number of correct guesses and display the user's score.
- **Leaderboard**: Save and display the top scores.
